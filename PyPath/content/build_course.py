"""Authoring script for PyPath course content.

Edit the data below and run:
    python content/build_course.py
It writes the course into app/src/main/assets/course/:
    course.json          course index (id, title, list of level files)
    levels/l1.json ...   one file per level (with its bonus project and cheat sheet)
    glossary.json        searchable Python terms
Level projects, cheat sheets and the glossary live in content/course_extras.py.
Batch 1 additions:
    content/mcq_feedback.py      hint + per-option feedback for every existing Level 1-6 MCQ
    content/advanced_levels.py   Levels 8-11 (Advanced): errors, modules, files, classes
    content/existing_course_baseline.json
                                 frozen copy of the pre-Batch-1 ids, lessons and questions;
                                 validation fails if any of them change
The app loads these at runtime. Adding a level or sub-level here requires NO Kotlin changes.

    python content/build_course.py           validate, then write the JSON files
    python content/build_course.py --check   validate and fail if the committed JSON is out of date

When it runs, the script also validates the content (see VALIDATION at the bottom):
ids, MCQ shape, answer-position balance, variety rules, and it executes every code
example with a known output to make sure the output shown to learners is correct.
Use Python 3.11 (the version bundled in the app by Chaquopy).
